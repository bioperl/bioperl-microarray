In order to follow MAGE naming conventions and also clean up/clarify some 
of the Bioperl-Microarray modules, 

the following changes were made:
Modules are now all documented! 

Changes to Bio::Expression::Microarray::MicroarrayIO
----------------------------------------------------
Module naming (affymetrix.pm, dchipxls.pm mas50txt.pm) and their 
interfaces remain the same. 
However the internals have been modified to reflect changes in the Affy 
Array module changes that are 

detailed below.


Changes to Bio::Expression::Microarray::Affymetrix:: modules
------------------------------------------------------------

Array.pm renamed to ArrayDesign.pm

Data.pm renamed to CelArray.pm

Feature.pm unchanged
